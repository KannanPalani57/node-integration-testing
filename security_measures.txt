* In general, make sure that installed node packages has no vulnerabilities

* Rate Limiting - Limiting request can be made for per day/hour/minute

* Maximum withdrawl per day

* check balance , if withdrawl amount higher than balance, block request before sending to provider

* Validate respective withdrawl address before sending to provider

*  Nice to have - Transaction Idempotency - Require a unique `idempotency-key` in the header. This prevents a user from accidentally sending the same withdrawal twice if their connection drops and they retry.
